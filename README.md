## **2. Lecture Notebooks Overview**

### **Week 1: Introduction to Data Science**
This notebook covers the basics of data science, the data lifecycle, and introduces common tools used in the field.

### **Week 2: Data Cleaning with Pandas**
Learn how to clean and preprocess datasets using **pandas**. This includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, and eliminating duplicates.

### **Week 3: Real-Time Data Processing**
This notebook focuses on real-time data streaming and chunk processing with **pandas**, covering techniques to process large datasets efficiently.

### **Week 4: Change Data Capture (CDC)**
Explore how to implement Change Data Capture to track and process only the changed data in a dataset, improving performance and reducing redundancy.

### **Week 5: Data Validation and Quality Assurance**
Understand how to apply validation rules to datasets, ensuring data quality through automated checks and corrections.

### **Week 6: Pathumthani Platform Data Integration**
A practical final project that demonstrates how to integrate tourism, agriculture, and sports data into a functional platform for analysis and insights.

### **Week 7: Conclusion and Future Work**
Summarizes the lessons learned from the course and suggests potential areas for expanding the platform with advanced analytics, new data sources, and user-friendly interfaces.

### **Week 8: Monadsquishy Data Transformation Tutorial**
This notebook explains the **Monadsquishy** tool, which applies monadic transformations to simplify data pipelines. Learn how to chain transformations, handle errors, and manage missing data using functional programming principles.
