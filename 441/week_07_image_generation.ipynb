    "### **Week 7: Image Generation using Stable Diffusion**\n",
    "#### **Objective:**\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the concepts of image generation, focusing on Text2Image models using the Stable Diffusion model. We will implement image generation using Stable Diffusion and see how it converts text prompts into images.\n",

    "Text2Image generation refers to the process of creating images based on a text description using machine learning models. Models like Stable Diffusion use a combination of text encoders and image decoders to generate photorealistic images based on input text prompts.\n",
